# ‚ö°Ô∏è Tom Cobut - Test Project ‚Äì Frontend Mock-up

## Overview

This is the completed test using **Bootstrap v5.3**, as requested.

Although my primary experience has been with **Tailwind CSS**, which has some similarities with Bootstrap, I decided to import a few utility classes from Tailwind into the SCSS. These classes helped speed up the workflow and keep the layout clean and efficient.

## ‚úÖ What I Find Good

- **Clear call-to-actions**: Buttons and links are visible and well-placed. However, CTA text should be **unified** (e.g., always using "Buy now") to avoid confusing the user.
- **Balanced color palette**: Colors are well balanced and visually appealing. That said, the final version should ideally use **Odoo's brand colors**.
- **Clean layout**: The section with the four features side by side is particularly effective‚Äîorganized, clear, and pleasant to navigate.

## üîß What I Would Improve

- **Font size consistency**: It's important to unify font sizes across headings (like H1, H2) and body text to maintain visual harmony and readability.
- **Accessibility contrast**: Ensure that all text and background combinations meet WCAG contrast guidelines to support all users, including those with visual impairments.

## Notes

Since I‚Äôve mostly worked with **Tailwind CSS**, I may have lost a few habits with **Bootstrap**. However, I adapt quickly, and I‚Äôm confident in my ability to re-learn and apply any Bootstrap techniques as needed.  
I have a strong drive to keep learning and improving, and I would be excited to grow alongside **Odoo** in this journey.

I‚Äôd be thrilled if my design skills are a perfect match for what Odoo is looking for.

Looking forward to your feedback ‚Äî I‚Äôm excited to see what‚Äôs next!

Thanks!  
Tom Cobut
